## 1. Solutions Considered

### a. Naive Line-by-Line Scan

**Approach**:  
Iterate over the entire 1 TB file line by line, check the date, and output matches.

**Pros**:
- Easy to implement.

**Cons**:
- Potentially very slow and resource-heavy.
- It requires reading the entire file even if you only need a small portion.

---

### b. Command-Line Tools (grep/awk/etc.)

**Approach**:  
Leverage system-level utilities like `grep` or `awk` to filter by date (e.g., `grep "YYYY-MM-DD" file`).

**Pros**:
- Simple one-liner.
- Native tools in C might be optimized.

**Cons**:
- Still reads the entire file.
- No random access or partial scanning.

### c. Splitting Logs as They Are Generated

**Approach**:  
If the system could have stored logs in daily or monthly files, retrieval would be trivial (just load the target file).

**Pros**:
- Almost instant retrieval for a specific date.

**Cons**:
- Requires changing how logs are generated or maintained.
- Not always feasible if you already have a single large file.

### d. Binary Search by Date (Chosen Approach)

**Approach**:  
Since the file is chronologically sorted and logs are evenly distributed over days, we can perform a binary search at the file-offset level to find the first occurrence of the target date. After locating the target date, we read sequentially until the date changes.

**Pros**:
- Minimizes scanning.
- Quickly jumps to the relevant portion of the file, significantly reducing I/O.

**Cons**:
- More complex logic to manage file offsets and partial lines.

## 2. Final Solution Summary

We selected the **Binary Search by Date** approach. Since each log begins with a timestamp in chronological order, we can quickly jump to the portion of the file that contains the target date. Once we find the start of that date, we scan forward until we reach the next day's logs.

This significantly reduces read time and system overhead for large files because we avoid examining vast sections of data that are guaranteed to be out of our date range.

## 3. Steps to Run

### 1. Set up your environment

- Install Python 3 (if it’s not already available).
- Ensure you have a large log file available (named `test_logs.log` or updated in the script if different).

---

### 2. Download or Clone the Repository

- Fork the contest repository, then clone your fork locally.

---

### 3. Place Your Scripts

- Put the final Python script (e.g., `extract_logs.py`) in the `src/` directory.
- Make sure to update the `LOG_FILE_PATH` in the script to point to the actual path of `test_logs.log`.

---

### 4. Run the Code

Open a terminal in your `src` directory and execute the following command:

```bash
python extract_logs.py 2024-12-01
